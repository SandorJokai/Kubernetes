As I am going through the learning process of Kubernetes, I see there are a quite a few aspects of K8s managing. In this
section, I am demonstrating how can we inject datas, configs, and even password secrets into a container.
Yes, kubernetes can manage the user login authentication into a running application, BUT! that is not as safe enough as we 
would think for the very first..

If we want to get a far more secured system, there's a few method based on secret object, however my aim was just to understand
this. For generic purpose, people might only use configMap object in order to inject generic configuration files when it's
need it. But as the most common point of view, we should let an image as immutable as we can. Sometimes though unavoidable to
inject datas this way for some reason, that is why I created this section.
