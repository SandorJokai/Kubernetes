So far, there are 2 yaml files. The first one (replicaset.yml) creates a replicaset and 3
absolutely same pods inside. In kubernetes, pod is the smallest object that can contain one or
more containers (usually just one). Containers provide services such as apache, created by 
docker, but all those things are hidden by kubernetes (noboby musn't to know necesseraly how 
it works behind the scenes). That is the philosophy of kubernetes: almost everything can be
automatized and we, DevOps people have to let the kubernetes do itself. 

So, according to the second yaml (services.yml) when we launch it in cli <<< kubectl create -f 
blabla-filename && kubectl get services >>> we can see the random generated port number that 
we can check in the browser typing the cluster's IP address followed by the port number. :)
